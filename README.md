# CoSoDisquoteByPaercebal

This small GreaseMonkey script is used to add a green "Disaquote!" button on your [Counter.Social](https://Counter.Social/ "Counter.Social") page (it could or could not also work with any Mastodon page).

This button, when clicked, replaces quotes (e.g. " and ') by their unicode variants (e.g. ” and ’) in your toot, so it won't be blocked by a HTTP 403 error for security reasons.

To use it, just:

- Install the GreaseMonkey addon in your Browser
- Click on the Monkey icon to open the menu, and select "New user script"
- In the newly opened window, paste the contents of the CoSoDisquoteByPaercebal.js file
- Save (CTRL+S)

Et voilà!
